## Overview

* Introduction to the course
* Identify major course objectives
* Identify course logistics and expectations
* Familiarize with basic principles of programming and reproducible workflow
* Software setup instructions

## Before class

* Read chapters 1 and 2 in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Very short chapters that set the stage for the course

## Class materials

* [Introduction to computing for the social sciences science](/notes/intro-to-course/)
* [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510). Optional, but good summary of best computing practices

## What you need to do after class

* [Install and setup software](/setup/)
* Fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/J8axkKpKZGxYyxYZA)
