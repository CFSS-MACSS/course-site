## Overview

* Define *exploratory data analysis* (EDA) and types of pattern exploration
* Demonstrate types of graphs useful for EDA and precautions when interpreting them
* Practice exploring data

## Before class

* Read Chapters 7-8 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Class materials

* [Exploratory data analysis](/notes/exploratory-data-analysis/)
* [Practice exploring college education (data)](/notes/exploratory-data-analysis-practice/)

## Additional resources

* [Graphical Data Analysis with R](http://proxy.uchicago.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1338290&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_A) - Antony Unwin. Great coverage of a range of graphical methods for data exploration and analysis. Also draws on packages beyond `ggplot2` for statistical graphics.
