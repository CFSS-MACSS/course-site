## Overview

* Review the major goals of statistical learning
* Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric methods
* Demonstrate how to estimate a linear model in R using `lm()`
* Introduce the `tidymodels` and `parsnip` packages for estimating regression models
* Practice estimating linear and logistic regression models

## Before class

* Read [Build a model](/notes/start-with-models/)
* Read [Logistic regress](/notes/logistic-regression/)

This is not a math/stats class. In class we will **briefly** summarize how these methods work and spend the bulk of our time on estimating and interpreting these models. That said, you should have some understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of statistical learning methods prior to implementing them yourselves. See below for some recommended readings:

##### For those with little/no statistics training

* Chapters 7-8 of [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os) - an open-source statistics textbook written at the level of an introductory undergraduate course on statistics

##### For those with prior statistics training

* Chapters 2-3, 4.1-3 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7) - a book on statistical learning written at the level of an advanced undergraduate/master's level course
* Chapters 4-5 in [*Hands-On Machine Learning with R*](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) - a recent publication which approaches these methods from the perspective of machine learning rather than traditional statistical inference. Includes code examples using R and the `caret` package.

## Class materials

* [Statistical learning: the basics](/notes/statistical-learning/)
* [Build a model](/notes/start-with-models/)
* [Logistic regression](/notes/logistic-regression/)
* [Working with statistical models](/notes/work-with-models-exercise/)

### Additional readings

* [`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) - a package which unifies hundreds of separate algorithms for generating statistical/machine learning models into a single standardized interface. Very robust, but pre-`tidyverse` and on the path to deprecation.
* [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) - a collection of packages for machine and statistical learning using `tidyverse` principles.
