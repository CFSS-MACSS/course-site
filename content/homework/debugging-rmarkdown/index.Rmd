# Overview

Due by 11:59pm on October 12th.

# Accessing the `hw05` repository

Go [here](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cis-fa22) and find your copy of the `hw05` repository. It follows the naming convention `hw05-<USERNAME>`. Clone the repository to your computer.

# Debugging code

The repository contains an R script called `babynames.R`. This script includes code to conduct analysis of baby name popularity in the United States using the [`babynames`](http://hadley.github.io/babynames/) package. Alas its author made some mistakes and the script currently does not work. Fix the errors/warnings in the script to generate the desired output.

# Working with Quarto documents

The homework repository contains a file called `hiv-profile.qmd`.

1. The file has some problems. Fix the problems so you can successfully knit the document in its existing form.
1. Create a [parameterized report](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/parameters.html) that allows you generate `hiv-profile.qmd` for any country in the dataset. Use this parameterized Quarto document to generate a separate report for each country and save them as HTML documents to a folder called `reports`.

{{% callout note %}}

Each file should be named after the country's iso3 code. For example, the report for the United States should be called `USA.html`.

{{% /callout %}}

# Submit the assignment

Your assignment should be submitted as several files:

1. The revised `babynames.R`.
1. The revised `hiv-profile.qmd` and the successfully rendered `hiv-profile.md` with associated output files (e.g. images).
1. An R script that renders all the individual country HIV profiles, as well as rendered HTML files.

Follow instructions on [homework workflow](/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow).

# Rubric

Needs improvement: The R script has not been successfully fixed. The broken Quarto document still does not knit. You manually generated each country's report.

Satisfactory: Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). Nothing spectacular, either bad or good.

Excellent: Repository contains a detailed `README.md` explaining how the files in the repo should be executed. Broken Quarto document successfully knits. Used iterative operations to generate each country's HIV profile.
