## Course Objectives

> https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/notes/intro-to-course/


The goal of this course is to acquire and practice **basic computational skills**. We focus on: learning R and learning practices for reproducible research. 


* Programming as a means to an end: analyzing social science data

* You will learn fundamental computational skills and techniques, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your own research

---

## Major Topics

* Basic R, Git/GitHub, R Markdown
* Data Visualization and Data Transformation 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Wrangling
* R Programming: Control Structures, Functions, Data Structures
* Debugging and defensive Programming
* Reproducible research
* Scraping
* Text-Analysis


---

## How we will do this

We will start small and progressively build more complex code


```{r hello-world, echo = TRUE}
print("Hello world!")
```

## Asking for help



### 15 min rule 
when stuck, you HAVE to try on your own for 15 min. After 15 min, you HAVE to ask for help.- Brain AMA <a href="https://t.co/MS7FnjXoGH">pic.twitter.com/MS7FnjXoGH</a></p>&mdash; Rachel Thomas (@math_rachel) <a href="https://twitter.com/math_rachel/status/764931533383749632">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

## Plagiarism

### Collaboration is good - *to a point*

* Learning from others/the internet is OK

* But you are expected to complete your own work

--

.task[If you don't understand what the program is doing and are not prepared to explain it in detail,
**you should not submit it**.]

## Evaluations


* Weekly programming assignments: eight in total

* Late Work Policy: you can submit up to two assignments up to 24 hours late without penalty; no questions asked. After 24 hours, we won't accept late work. In case of sickness, etc. contact me ahead of time

### Jane: a GUI workflow

1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in Excel
1. Analyzes the data in Stata
1. Writes her report in Google Docs

### Sally: a programmatic workflow

1. Creates a folder specifically for this project
    * `data`
    * `graphics`
    * `output`
1. Searches for data files online
1. Cleans the files in R
1. Analyzes the files in R
1. Writes her report in R Markdown

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%", fig.width = 5}
include_graphics(path = "https://i.imgflip.com/1szkun.jpg")
```

---

## Automation


* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
    
    
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box)
* Version control software
    * Repository

## Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

---

## Badly documented code

```{r sesame-bad, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
tml1 <- get_timeline("MeCookieMonster", 3000)
tml2 <- get_timeline("Grover", 3000)
tml3 <- get_timeline("elmo", 3000)
tml4 <- get_timeline("CountVonCount", 3000)
ts_plot(group_by(bind_rows(select(tml1, created_at), select(tml2, created_at), select(tml3, created_at), select(tml4, created_at), .id = "screen_name"), screen_name), by = "months")
```

---

## Good code

```{r rtweet-auth, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(rtweet)

# retrieve stored bearer token
# changed from ("cfss") to ("rcis")
auth_as("rcis")
```

.tiny[
```{r sesame-good, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# get_to_sesame_street.R
# Program to retrieve recent tweets from Sesame Street characters

# load packages for data management and Twitter API
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)

# retrieve most recent 3000 tweets of best Sesame Street residents
cookie <- get_timeline(
  user = "MeCookieMonster",
  n = 3000
)

grover <- get_timeline(
  user = "Grover",
  n = 3000
)

elmo <- get_timeline(
  user = "elmo",
  n = 3000
)

count_von_count <- get_timeline(
  user = "CountVonCount",
  n = 3000
)

# combine, group by character, and plot weekly tweet frequency
bind_rows(
  `Cookie Monster` = cookie %>% select(created_at),
  Grover = grover %>% select(created_at),
  Elmo = elmo %>% select(created_at),
  `Count von Count` = count_von_count %>% select(created_at),
  .id = "screen_name"
) %>%
  group_by(screen_name) %>%
  ts_plot(by = "months")
```
]

---

## Good code

```{r ref.label = "sesame-good", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = "80%", eval = FALSE}
```
