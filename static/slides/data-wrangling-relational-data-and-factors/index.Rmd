# Introduction to relational data

* Multiple tables of data that when combined together answer research questions
* Relations define the important element, not just the individual tables
* Relations are defined between a pair of tables
* Relational verbs
    * Mutating joins
    * Filtering joins

# Factors

* Used for categorical (discrete) variables
* Historically used for purposes of efficiency
* Not really necessary in modern R
* Best used to sort categorical variables other than alphabetically
* `forcats`

---

# Factors

## Character vector

```{r char, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"))
sort(x1)
```

---

# Factors

## Levels

```{r levels, dependson = "char", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)
```

## Factor

```{r factor, dependson = "levels", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(y1 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels))
parse_factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
```

---

# Different levels/labels

```{r months-num, dependson = "levels", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(x2 <- c(12, 4, 1, 3))
(y2 <- factor(x2, 
              levels = seq(from = 1, to = 12),
              labels = month_levels))
```
