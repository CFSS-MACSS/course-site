# Relational data structures

---

## Introduction to relational data

* Multiple tables of data that when combined together answer research questions
* Relations define the important element, not just the individual tables
* Relations are defined between a pair of tables
* Relational verbs
    * Mutating joins
    * Filtering joins

# Mutating joins

---

## `inner_join()`

```{r ijsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_inner_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `inner_join()`

```{r ijsp, echo = TRUE}
inner_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `left_join()`

```{r ljsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_left_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `left_join()`

```{r ljsp, echo = TRUE}
left_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `right_join()`

```{r rjsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_right_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `right_join()`

```{r rjsp, echo = TRUE}
right_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `right_join()` reversed

```{r rjsp-alt-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_left_join(x = publishers, y = superheroes, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `full_join()`

```{r fjsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_full_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `full_join()`

```{r fjsp, echo = TRUE}
full_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

class: inverse, middle

# Filtering joins

---

## `semi_join()`

```{r sjsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_semi_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `semi_join()`

```{r sjsp, echo = TRUE}
semi_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `anti_join()`

```{r ajsp-anim, dependson = "anim-opts"}
animate_anti_join(x = superheroes, y = publishers, by = "publisher")
```

---

## `anti_join()`

```{r ajsp, echo = TRUE}

# Factors

---

## Factors

* Used for categorical (discrete) variables
* Historically used for purposes of efficiency
* Not really necessary in modern R
* Best used to sort categorical variables other than alphabetically
* `forcats`

---

## Character vector

```{r char, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"))
sort(x1)
```

---

## Levels

```{r levels, dependson = "char", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)
```

--

## Factor

```{r factor, dependson = "levels", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(y1 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels))
parse_factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
```

---

## Different levels/labels

```{r months-num, dependson = "levels", echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
(x2 <- c(12, 4, 1, 3))
y2 <- factor(x2,
  levels = seq(from = 1, to = 12),
  labels = month_levels
)
y2
```
