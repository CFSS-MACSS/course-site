# Gun deaths by age

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

# Gun deaths by race

```{r race-dist}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Victim race")
```

# Major components

1. A **YAML header** surrounded by `---`s
1. **Chunks** of R code surounded by ` ``` `
1. Text mixed with simple text formatting using the [Markdown syntax](../hw01-edit-README.html)

# Stop, collaborate, and listen

* Render `gun-deaths.Rmd` as an HTML document
* Add text describing the frequency polygon

```{r cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---

# Code chunks

````{verbatim, lang = 'markdown', echo = TRUE}
```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# code goes here
```
````

--

* Naming code chunks
* Code chunk options
* `eval = FALSE`
* `include = FALSE`
* `echo = FALSE`
* `message = FALSE` or `warning = FALSE`
* `error = TRUE`
* `cache = TRUE`

---

# Global options

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)
```

---

# Inline code

```{r youth, include = FALSE}
youth <- gun_deaths %>%
  filter(age <= 65)

# Ice is back with my brand new invention

* Set `echo = FALSE` as a global option
* Enable caching as a global option and render the document. Look at the file structure for the cache. Now render the document again. Does it run faster?

```{r cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 7)
```

# YAML header

```{r yml-default}
yml_default <- yml() %>%
  yml_title("Gun deaths") %>%
  yml_author("Benjamin Soltoff") %>%
  yml_date(lubridate::today())
```

```{r yml-basic, comment = "", dependson = "yml-default"}
yml_default %>%
  yml_output(github_document())
```

* **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage
* Standardized format for storing hierarchical data in a human-readable syntax
* Defines how `rmarkdown` renders your `.Rmd` file

---

# HTML document

```{r yml-html, comment = "", dependson = "yml-default"}
yml_default %>%
  yml_output(html_document())
```

---

# Table of contents

```{r yml-toc, comment = "", dependson = "yml-default"}
yml_default %>%
  yml_output(html_document(
    toc = TRUE,
    toc_depth = 2L
  ))
```

---

# Appearance and style

```{r yml-theme, comment = "", dependson = "yml-default"}
yml_default %>%
  yml_output(html_document(
    theme = "readable",
    highlight = "pygments"
  ))
```

---

# Something grabs a hold of me tightly

* Add a table of contents
* Use the `"cerulean"` theme
* Modify the figures so they are 8x6

```{r cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 7)
```

# PDF document

```{r yml-pdf, comment = "", dependson = "yml-default"}

  yml_output(pdf_document())

# `render()`

rmarkdown::render("my-document.Rmd", output_format = "all")
```

---

# Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

* Render `gun-deaths.Rmd` as both an HTML document and a PDF document
    * If you do not have $\LaTeX$ installed, render as an HTML document and a Word document

```{r cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)

# R scripts

```{embed, file = here("static", "extras", "gun-deaths.R"), echo = TRUE}
```

# When to use a script

* For troubleshooting
* Initial stages of project
* Building a reproducible pipeline
* It depends

--

## Running scripts

* Interactively
* Programmatically using `source()`
