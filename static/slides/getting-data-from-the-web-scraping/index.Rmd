# Scraping without an API

### Last time we learned two main concepts...

### Last time we learned two main concepts...

#### Concept 1: What is behind a website
* a website is made of mostly HTML, CSS, JS
* **HTML** the website's "skeleton"; it is built with **tags** that follow a hierarchical, tree-like structure 
* **CSS** builds on top of HTML and makes it prettier

#### Concept 2: How computers interact on the web
* the browser sends a request to the server that hosts the website
* the server sends back a response code + a response content written in HTML
* the browser translates the response content written in HTML into nicely rendered the website

# HTML: HyperText Markup Language

---

##  HTML structure

* `html`
    * `head`
        * `title`
        * `a href`
        * `script`
    * `body`
        * `div`
            * `p`
                * `b`
            * `span`
        * `table`
            * `tr`
                * `td`
                * `td`
        * `img`

---

##  HTML structure

* `html`
    * `head`
        * `title`
        * `a href` -- links
        * `script` -- code
    * `body`
        * `div` -- generic container for content (block)
            * `p` -- paragraph
                * `b` -- bold formatting
            * `span` -- generic container for content (in line)
        * `table`
            * `tr` -- row of cells
                * `td` -- actual cell element 
                * `td`
        * `img`


---

## HTML structure: example

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
    <script src="https://c.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>Click <b>here</b> now.</p>
      <span>Frozen</span>
    </div>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <td>Kristen</td>
        <td>Bell</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images.png"/>
  </body>
</html>
```
]
Find: (1) the text content `Frozen`; (2) the GitHub link and the text content `GitHub`

---

## Components of HTML code

**Find the text content `Frozen`:**

```html
<span>Frozen</span>
```

* `<span></span>` - tag name
* `Frozen` - content as text

<!--In this ex. there is only one span tag: what if the HTML has multiple span tags?-->
--

**Find the GitHub link and text content `GitHub`:**

```html
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
```

* `<a></a>` - tag name
* `href` - tag attribute (argument)
* `"http://github.com"` - tag attribute (value)
* `GitHub` - content as text

---

# CSS: Cascading Style Sheet

---

## CSS code

Often a website has HTML + CSS:
* **HTML defines the content** 
* **CSS defines the format** 

This is an example of CSS code. Notice the `span` HTML tag can be styled using CSS `color`: 

```css
span {
  color: #ffffff;
}

table.data {
  width: auto;
```
--

Most websites use HTML with tags such `class` and `id` to provide “hooks” for their CSS. This way the CSS "knows" where to apply CSS stylistic elements.

Example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class

## HTML + CSS code: example 

.pull-left[

```html
<body>
    <table id="content">
        <tr class='name'>
            <td class='firstname'>
                Kurtis
            </td>
            <td class='lastname'>
                McCoy
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class='name'>
            <td class='firstname'>
                Leah
            </td>
            <td class='lastname'>
                Guerrero
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
```

]

.pull-right[

Find the HTML/CSS code to extract:
1. The entire table
1. The general element(s) containing first names
1. Just the specific element "Kurtis"

# `rvest`

---
## Packages to read html: rvest

* [`rvest`](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/): allows you to scrape (harvest...get it...) data from the web
* works great with tidyverse
* can 'flatten' the hierarchical html/css elements into something we can more easily work with:
  * by HTML tags or attributes
  * by CSS selectors


---
## Using `rvest` to read HTML: functions to know

`read_html` - read HTML data from a url or character string.

`html_nodes` - select specified nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors.

`html_table` - parse an HTML table into a data frame.

`html_text` - extract tag pairs' content.

`html_name` - extract tags' names.

`html_attrs` - extract all of each tag's attributes.

`html_attr` - extract tags' attribute value by name.

# Exercise: Practice all of this in R using `rvest`

### `rvest`: https://rvest.tidyverse.org/
### Scraping presidential statements

---
# Exercise: Practice all of this in R using `rvest`

**Let’s start with step one:**

* We use the `read_html` function from the `rvest` package to call the URL we want data from, grab the HTML response, and store it as an object.
* We are going to scrape data from this URL: `https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-relative-space-science-and-exploration`

---

## Get the page with `read_html`

```{r get-statement, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

url <- "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-relative-space-science-and-exploration"

dwight <- read_html(x = url)

dwight
```
--

This is not very informative. We can do better! How? `rvest` lets us find and grab the specific HTML/CSS elements that we want from a webpage:
  * by HTML tags or attributes
  * by CSS selectors

---

## Find specific elements with `html_elements`

For example, if we want to find **all `a` elements** in the HTML of our webpage (which we saved in the object `dwight`), we run the following code:

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[R Code]
```{r nodes, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
out<-html_elements(x = dwight, css = "a")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[R output]
```{r nodes-out, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
out
```
]
]

--

Observe the output: 
* Many elements on the same page have the same HTML tag. So, if we search for all `a` tags, we will likely get a lot of stuff, much of which we do not want.
* We can be more precise! For example, we might want to find **only the element that contains the document's speaker: "Dwight D. Eisenhower"**. How?
  * find it on the webpage
  * modify the above code accordingly

---

## Find specific elements with `html_elements`

#### To find a specific element, we need to inspect the HTML of the website. We can do so in two ways:

1. **Directly**: by right clicking on the page and select "Inspect" (notice here we need the content of the specific `a` tag, which is nested under `<h3 class="diet-title">`).

--

2. Using the **SelectorGadget**: 
* See [here](https://selectorgadget.com/) and [here](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/selectorgadget.html)
* Drag the SelectorGadget link into your browser's bookmark bar
* Navigate to a webpage and open the SelectorGadget bookmark
* Click on the item to scrape, it will turn green
* Click on yellow items you do not want to scrape (scroll up and down to check)
* Copy the selector to use with `html_elements()`

I generally rely on method 1 or start with the SelectorGadget and confirm with method 1.

---

## Find specific elements with `html_elements`

Finally, we are ready to find **only the element that contains the document's speaker: "Dwight D. Eisenhower".** We modify the previous code accordingly:

```{r get-speaker, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
html_elements(x = dwight, css = ".diet-title a")
```

--

Once we have identified the element(s) of interest, usually we want to **access further information included in those elements**. Oftentimes this means two things: text and attributes, and `rvest` has two handy functions: 
* `html_text2()` for text
* `html_attr()` for attributes

---

### Get text of elements with `html_text2()`

```{r get-speaker-text, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}

speaker_name <- html_elements(dwight, ".diet-title a") %>% 
  html_text2() 

speaker_name
```
--

### Get attributes of elements with `html_attr()`

```{r get-speaker-link, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}

speaker_link <- html_elements(dwight, ".diet-title a") %>% 
  html_attr("href") # note a is the tag, href is its attribute

speaker_link
```

#### We can keep using `html_text2()` and `html_attr()` to select other things of interest such as: this statement's date, its title, or its text body.

---

### Date of statement

As a string (character):
```{r get-date, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
date <- html_elements(x = dwight, css = ".date-display-single") %>%
  html_text2()

date
```

As a date (double of class "Date"):
```{r get-date-mdy, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
library(lubridate)

date <- html_elements(x = dwight, css = ".date-display-single") %>%
  html_text2() %>%
  mdy() # format the element text using lubridate

date
class(date)
```

---

### Title

```{r get-title, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
title <- html_elements(x = dwight, css = "h1") %>%
  html_text2()
title
```

--

### Text

```{r get-text, dependson = "get-statement", eval = FALSE}
text <- html_elements(x = dwight, css = "div.field-docs-content") %>%
  html_text2()

# display the first 1,000 characters
text %>% str_sub(1, 1000) 
```
 
**Now we know how to extract, the speaker, date, title, and full text from this document!**

---

## Make a function

Think: **Why are we doing through all this effort to scrape just one page?**

Make a function called `scrape_docs` that:

- Take as argument an URL of an single webpage
- Get the HTML of that page 
- Scrapes it
- Returns a data frame containing the document's
    - Date
    - Speaker
    - Title
    - Full text

---

.small[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

scrape_doc <- function(url) {
  
  # get HTML page
  url_contents <- read_html(x = url)
  
  # extract elements we want
  date <- html_elements(x = url_contents, css = ".date-display-single") %>%
    html_text2() %>% mdy()
  
  speaker <- html_elements(x = url_contents, css = ".diet-title a") %>%
    html_text2()
  
  title <- html_elements(x = url_contents, css = "h1") %>%
    html_text2()
  
  text <- html_elements(x = url_contents, css = "div.field-docs-content") %>%
    html_text2()
  
  # store in a data frame and return it
  url_data <- tibble(
    date = date,
    speaker = speaker,
    title = title,
    text = text
  )
  return(url_data)
}
```
]

---

### Call the function to scrape documents from the UCSB website:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url_1 <- "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/letter-t-keith-glennan-administrator-national-aeronautics-and-space-administration"
scrape_doc(url_1)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url_2 <- "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/letter-the-president-the-senate-and-the-speaker-the-house-representatives-proposing"
scrape_doc(url_2)
```

**Challenge**: How could we further automate our scraper so we do not have to pass 4000+ URLs (that's the amount of URLs in `https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/app-categories/presidential/letters`) each time?
* collect all URLs on that page, and store them in a list or character vector
* notice each page has about 10 URLs, so we need to tell the scraper to turn page
* apply our `scrape_doc` function to the list of URLs, one at a time 

*recall your practice with homework 05 to loop over filenames!*

### Both examples are included in today's class materials:

#### Example 01: Sperling's Best Places 

> **Task 1:** look up the cost of living for your hometown on Sperling's Best Places website: http://www.bestplaces.net/ and extract it with `html_elements()` and `html_text2()`

> **Task 2:** get the first table with `html_table()` and put it to a data frame

> **Task 3:** extract the climate statistics table of your hometown 

#### Example 02: Movie information from IMDb 

> Note: this is different than OMDb, which we used as example to scrape with an API

# Rectangling or Simplifying lists

---

### Rectangling

Rectangling or simplifying lists: means taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns.

If you need to simplify nested lists for your scraping project **make sure to check today's class materials for a tutorial and examples of rectangling!**

# Scraping challanges, tips, and ethics 


---

## Scraping: General tips

* Confirm that there is no R package and no API
* Make sure your code scrapes only what you want (and not additional information)
* Save and store the content of what you scrape, so to avoid scraping it again

---

## Scraping: Challanges & Solutions

* **Variety:** every website is different, so pretty much every website requires a new project

* **Bad formatting**: websites should be built using "logical formatting" following a properly nested HTML structure. In practice, that's often not the case. If you are having trouble parsing, try selecting a smaller subset of the thing you are seeking

* **Change:** the same website might change over time, so you might find that your code of a few months ago does not work anymore. The good news is that, usually, it takes only a few changes to run it again

* **Limits:** some websites set a max amount of data you can scrape at once, for example 50 pages or 2500 articles max. The solution is to break your requests into "chunks"

* **Messy:** the scraped data are usually a bit messy, and they need to be cleaned

* **Dynamic Scraping:** this not really a challenge but something to keep in mind: many websites incorporate Javascript dynamic parts which requires advanced scraping skills

---

## Scraping: Ethics

* **Private data (not OK) VS. Public data (OK):** If there is a password, it is private data. For example, it is not OK to scrape data from an online community where only logged-in users can access posts (unless you use the API provided by the website and follow its rules). **In general: if the website has an API, use it.**

* **Check the `robots.txt`** before you scrape by adding `/robots.txt` at the end of your URL. For example, for the NYT Robot File, type: `https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt`. The star after "User-agent" means "the following is valid for all robots"; things you cannot scrape are under "Disallow". More info [here](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html)

* **Read the website’s Terms of Service (ToS):** legal rules you agree to observe in order to use a service. Violating ToS exposes you to the risk of violating CFAA or "Computer Fraud & Abuse Act", which is a federal crime.

* **If you are scraping lots of data:** use `rvest` together with `polite`. The polite package ensures that you’re respecting the `robots.txt` and not hammering the site with too many requests.

* For more info on ethical issues, check the **hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn** lawsuit case.

---

## Recap

* Use an API when you can
* Be `polite`
* Read `robots.txt`
* Use publicly available data
